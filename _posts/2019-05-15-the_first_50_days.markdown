After being a student of Flatiron for 50 days, I am happy to say that coding is actually making sense to me now! When I first began the course, I was immediately overwhelmed. I wondered if I had gotten myself into something that I'd regret. I wondered if it was too much of a load for me to handle both school and work. While it has been difficult to find a balance between the two, I've managed to put together a schedule that works for both.

One thing I have noticed was that on days I worked, it was becoming far too easy to get home and not even think about coding. There were times when I went a full two days without even bothering to peek at my coursework. Between renovating my new apartment and working, I can't say I've had too much free time but I don't think I was making the best effort to actually read through or at the very least, skim my coursework.

Things changed after my very first phone call with my educational coach, Katie McKenna. After doing some brainstorming, we realized that I needed a way to keep me engaged with coding even if that meant listening to a coding podcast on my long morning and afternoon commutes or doing a lesson or two during my busiest of days. The important thing was that I kept myself engaged to the course and to coding in general. Before our phone call, I was not very optimistic about finishing up the course in a year or less. I thought that maybe I worked too much to dedicate enough time to the course. After the phone call, I realized that if I prioritized my time better, I could possibly get more lessons done per week which would allow me to finish the course sooner. Having an educational coach that can provide these types of ideas while motivating me will be very helpful to me during my time here at Flatiron. I am very thankful that this type of service is provided to students as I will now be held accountable for my progress (in a good way!).

After a very tiring and stressful 50 days, my apartment renovations should be nearing completion and my job will be going through a somewhat dormant period during the summertime. Things can only get better from here and I hope that I can be more involved in the student community here at Flatiron.

Here's to the next 50 days!
