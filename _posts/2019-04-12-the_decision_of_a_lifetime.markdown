One month ago, I decided to change my career. This was not a decision I made in a day, a week, or even a month. It was tough! I had a bachelors degree and I had a full-time job. Why change careers? Was it too late? Am I too old to be changing careers? I had just turned 29 and was close to the dreaded 3-0. Even when changing careers was merely an afterthought, these were the questions that kept me up at night. 

After talking to friends, family, and my fiance, I realized that I just wasn't as happy as I could be at my job. It payed the bills but it wasn't something that felt fulfilling as it should be. 

I didn't exactly stick my hand in a hat full of different careers to figure things out. Web development has always intrigued me. The idea that a big block of text can be displayed as a functioning website was something that I found amazing. How could that huge mess produce something so beautiful and neat? The idea that I could come up with an app or web application that was accessible to the world was an idea that I could not let go. 

I wanted that power. I wanted that ability. I wanted this career. 

It was time to make a life-changing decision and that is how I ended up here at Flatiron. The journey has just begun and I hope that when it is all said and done, the decision pays off.
